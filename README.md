# SimpleRL
Simple library for RL based bots

## General Idea

* Provide abstract classes to simply create standardized 1P-2P games
* Organize player interaction systematically, allowing both bots and humans to play the games
* Implement a stub for Deep Q Network, that is NN architecture independent (Replay Buffer, eps-greedy policy...)
* Provide a basic implementation of the Q-loss

We use `torch` for the NN stuff.
